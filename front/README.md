# Frontend (Nuxt 4) Starter

This directory contains a fresh Nuxt 4 application that replaces the legacy frontend.  
The project currently ships three public routes:

- `/` – Home page with a product overview hero and feature highlights
- `/login` – Authentication form placeholder
- `/registration` – Registration form placeholder

Use this scaffold as the starting point for future feature development while the original frontend remains untouched elsewhere in the repository.

## Setup

Install dependencies inside the `front` directory:

```bash
cd front
npm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Production Build

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

Check out the [deployment documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment) for more information.
